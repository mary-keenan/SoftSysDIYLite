# DIY SQLite
By Mary Keenan

## Goals
The goal of this project is to make my own version of SQLite, a relational database. My MVP will be a database that can save data to the disk and fetch it. A stretch goal will be to investigate more efficient ways of storing and fetching the data.

## Learning Goals
My learning goal is to practice C and learn more about how relational databases work.

## Resources
I plan to follow this tutorial, https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/, to reach my MVP. From there, I'll research more ways to structure the data to make it easier/faster to save/search. I'm not yet sure what improvements I could make, but by the end of this tutorial, I should hopefully have a better grasp on the topic and some ideas.
